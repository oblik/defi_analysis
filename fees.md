# APY, TVL, and Fees

## APY
Annual Percentage Yield (APY) represents the real rate of return earned on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest.

## TVL
Total Value Locked (TVL) is the aggregate amount of assets deposited in a protocol, typically measured in USD.

## Fees
Fees are the costs associated with transactions on different blockchains. These can vary based on network activity, protocol, and the native token used for gas.

| Protocol           | Gas (Native Token)                        | Fee (USD Equivalent, Typical)         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ethereum (ETH)     | ETH (dynamic, depends on network activity)| $1.50 – $15.00 per transaction        |
| BNB Chain (BSC)    | BNB (dynamic, lower than ETH)             | ~$0.02 per transaction                |
| Polygon (PoS)      | MATIC (gas price in gwei; very low)       | ~$0.001 – $0.01 per transaction       |
| Tron (TRC20)       | TRX (uses "energy" and "bandwidth")        | $2.00 – $5.53 per transaction         |
| Arbitrum Orbit     | ETH or USDC (can pay gas in USDC)         | Lower than ETH L1; varies             |
